## purpose
This project is intended to allow me to review PySpark, create helper classes, etc.

Initially, it will likely be spartan/incomplete

## incomplete disclaimers
Yes, PySpark really only makes sense if you're accessing a distributed processing system. This project may not practically utilize one. (TBD)
